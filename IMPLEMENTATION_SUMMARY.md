# Implementation Summary: Schema Restructuring

## Overview

Successfully implemented the separation of **people** from **organizations** in the content schema, creating a reference-based system for managing contributors, authors, and affiliations across the Semio Community platform.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. New Components Created

#### PersonHoverCard (React + Radix UI)
- **File**: `src/components/PersonHoverCard.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Displays person avatar or initials fallback
  - Shows name, title, current affiliation
  - Expandable hover card with full bio
  - Links to GitHub, ORCID, website, email
  - Expertise tags display
  - Fully styled with Tailwind CSS

#### PersonHoverCardWrapper (Astro)
- **File**: `src/components/PersonHoverCardWrapper.astro`
- **Purpose**: Astro wrapper for React component
- **Features**:
  - Fetches person data from content collection
  - Resolves current affiliation details
  - Passes data to React component

#### OrganizationChip (Astro)
- **File**: `src/components/OrganizationChip.astro`
- **Features**:
  - Displays organization logo or icon
  - Shows short name or full name
  - Optional role display
  - Links to partner page

### 2. Schema Updates

#### Updated Collections
- **Hardware**: Added `contributors`, `leadOrganization`, `supportingOrganizations`
- **Software**: Added `contributors`, `leadOrganization`, `supportingOrganizations`
- **Studies**: Changed authors to reference people collection
- **Events**: Updated organizers and speakers to use references
- **People**: New collection with comprehensive person profiles
- **Partners**: Refined to be organizations only

### 3. Data Functions Updated

#### hardware.ts
- Replaced `getHardwareByInstitution` with `getHardwareByOrganization`
- Updated `getUniqueInstitutions` to `getUniqueOrganizations`
- Fixed search function to use new organization fields
- Fixed status priority handling

#### software.ts
- Replaced `getSoftwareByInstitution` with `getSoftwareByOrganization`
- Updated `getUniqueInstitutions` to `getUniqueOrganizations`
- Fixed search function to use new organization fields

#### events.ts
- Updated search to work with new organizer/speaker structure
- Fixed `getEventsByOrganizer` to use ID references

#### people.ts (New)
- Created comprehensive people data helper functions
- `getAllPeople()`: Get all public people
- `getPerson()`: Get single person by ID
- `getPeopleByOrganization()`: Filter by affiliation
- `getFormattedAuthors()`: Format author names for display
- `searchPeople()`: Full-text search across people

### 4. UI Updates

#### DetailLayout.astro
- Added contributors section with separate areas for:
  - Organizations (lead and supporting)
  - Individual contributors with hover cards
  - Contributing organizations
- Removed deprecated maintainers section
- Styled with consistent design language

#### studies.astro
- Fixed author display to use person references
- Pre-fetches author names to avoid async issues in templates
- Maintains "et al." formatting for multiple authors

### 5. Sample Content Created

#### People Entries
- `jane-smith.mdx`: Full professor profile with affiliations, expertise, links
- `john-doe.mdx`: PhD candidate profile with multiple affiliations
- `andy-schoen.mdx`: Existing profile updated to match new schema

## Technical Decisions

### Why Radix UI for Hover Cards
- Provides accessible, unstyled components
- Handles positioning, portals, and interactions
- Integrates well with React and Tailwind CSS
- Already partially installed in the project

### Reference-Based Architecture
- **Benefits**:
  - Single source of truth for each person/organization
  - Easy updates (change once, reflected everywhere)
  - Rich relationship tracking
  - Historical affiliation support
  
### Separation of Concerns
- **People**: Individual researchers, developers, contributors
- **Partners**: Organizations, institutions, companies
- **Contributors**: Can be either people or organizations
- **Affiliations**: Time-based relationships between people and organizations

## Migration Path

### For Existing Content

1. **Hardware/Software Entries**:
   ```yaml
   # Old
   maintainers: ["Jane Smith", "John Doe"]
   institutions: ["MIT", "George Mason University"]
   
   # New
   contributors:
     - type: "person"
       id: "jane-smith"
       role: "Lead Developer"
     - type: "person"
       id: "john-doe"
       role: "Maintainer"
   leadOrganization: "mit"
   supportingOrganizations: ["george-mason-university"]
   ```

2. **Study Authors**:
   ```yaml
   # Old
   authors:
     - name: "Jane Smith"
       affiliation: "GMU"
       orcid: "0000-0002-1825-0097"
   
   # New
   authors:
     - personId: "jane-smith"
       order: 1
       corresponding: true
   ```

### Migration Script Template
A template migration script is provided in `migration-plan.md` to automate content conversion.

## Testing Checklist

### Functional Tests
- [x] PersonHoverCard displays on hover
- [x] Organization chips link correctly
- [x] Build completes without TypeScript errors
- [x] Contributors section appears in DetailLayout
- [ ] Mobile responsive behavior
- [ ] Accessibility (keyboard navigation, screen readers)

### Content Tests
- [x] Person entries load correctly
- [x] References resolve properly
- [ ] Missing references handled gracefully
- [ ] Performance with many contributors

## Known Issues & Limitations

1. **Content Migration**: Existing content needs manual or scripted migration
2. **Empty Collections**: Studies collection is empty (warning in build)
3. **Partner References**: Need to ensure all referenced partners exist
4. **Avatar Images**: Need proper image handling for person avatars

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Priority 1)
1. Migrate existing content to new schema
2. Create more people entries for existing contributors
3. Test with real hardware/software entries
4. Fix any remaining TypeScript errors

### Short-term (Priority 2)
1. Add search functionality for people
2. Create people index page
3. Add filtering by expertise/organization
4. Implement contributor statistics

### Long-term (Priority 3)
1. Collaboration network visualization
2. Contributor activity timeline
3. Organization relationship graphs
4. ORCID integration for automatic profile updates

## Performance Considerations

- **Build Time**: Multiple `getEntry` calls may impact build time with many contributors
- **Client Bundle**: React components add ~10KB to client bundle
- **Optimization Opportunities**:
  - Consider static rendering for hover card content
  - Implement lazy loading for avatars
  - Cache person/organization lookups

## Developer Notes

### Adding a New Person
1. Create file in `src/content/people/[person-id].mdx`
2. Use the schema defined in `content.config.ts`
3. Ensure `id` matches filename
4. Set appropriate `visibility` level

### Referencing Contributors
- Always use the person's `id` (filename without extension)
- Roles are optional but recommended
- Current status defaults to `true`

### Styling Customization
- Components use Tailwind CSS classes
- Color scheme uses semantic tokens (accent-one, accent-two, etc.)
- Responsive breakpoints follow Tailwind defaults

## Conclusion

The schema restructuring successfully separates people from organizations, providing a robust foundation for managing complex relationships in the Semio Community ecosystem. The implementation uses modern React components with Radix UI for enhanced user experience while maintaining compatibility with Astro's static site generation.

The reference-based system eliminates data duplication and provides flexibility for future features like collaboration networks and detailed contributor analytics. With proper content migration, this new structure will significantly improve data maintainability and enable richer user experiences across the platform.
