title: "Examining the Adoption of Expressive Faces for Humanoid Robots in Industry and Academia"
abstract: "A qualitative study examining the adoption of expressive faces, like the Peerbots face, for humanoid robots in industry and academia. Using speculative design methods, this research focuses on understanding the needs that decision-makers are taking into consideration about the facial expression of the robots they are designing."

## Fellowship Overview

Dylan Thomas Doyle is the 2025 Peerbots Research Fellow. As a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Colorado Boulder, Dylan's work focuses on values-based design for robots and the impacts of socio-technical contexts on the perception of robot identity.

## Research Focus

This fellowship research conducts a qualitative study examining the adoption of expressive faces for humanoid robots in industry and academia, with particular attention to systems like the Peerbots face. The study employs speculative design methods to understand the considerations and needs that decision-makers take into account when determining the facial expression capabilities of the robots they are designing.

## About the Fellow

Dylan Thomas Doyle is an HRI researcher whose work centers on values-based design for robots and the impacts of socio-technical contexts on the perception of robot identity. Outside of research, Dylan serves as the Director of the AI for All Tomorrows media collective and podcast.

Dylan received his PhD from the University of Colorado Boulder, Masters of Divinity from Columbia University, and BA from Sarah Lawrence College. Prior to a career in technology research, Dylan served as a Unitarian Universalist minister and hospital chaplain.

## About the Peerbots Research Fellowship

The Peerbots Research Fellowship is part of Peerbots' commitment to raising the floor of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) research and getting more experts involved in HRI research. The program aims to support researchers centering people, and specifically experts, in how robots are researched, developed, and used. The fellowship funds an early career researcher or researcher in training to complete at least one study and submit a publication to a leading academic venue.
