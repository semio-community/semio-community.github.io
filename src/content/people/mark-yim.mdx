Mark Yim is the Asa Whitney Professor of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania and Director of the GRASP Lab. A pioneer in modular robotics, his research focuses on the design and control of modular self-reconfigurable robots, biologically inspired mechanisms, and novel robotic systems.

His groundbreaking work in modular robotics has established fundamental principles for how robots can be built from standardized, interchangeable modules that can self-assemble and reconfigure to accomplish different tasks. This work has profound implications for creating adaptable, resilient robotic systems that can morph their shape and functionality to meet changing requirements.

Beyond modular robotics, Mark's research spans a diverse range of innovative robotic systems, from snake-like robots that can navigate through rubble for search and rescue, to flying robots with novel propulsion mechanisms, to soft robots for medical applications. His approach combines rigorous mechanical design principles with creative, bio-inspired solutions to create robots that push the boundaries of what's possible.

As Director of the GRASP Lab, one of the world's leading robotics research centers, Mark fosters an environment of interdisciplinary collaboration and innovation. His mentorship has produced numerous leaders in the robotics field, and his work continues to influence the development of next-generation robotic systems across academia and industry.
