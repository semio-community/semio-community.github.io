Saad is the Executive Director of Peerbots, a U.S. based nonprofit organization providing a research-informed social robot platform for roboticists and non-roboticists. He received his Ph.D. from the Colorado School of Mines where he studied how therapists and educators use social robots in the wild. Now, at Peerbots, his research has expanded to broadly focus on the design and deployment of Social Robot End-User tools.
