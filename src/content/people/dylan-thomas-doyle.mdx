Dylan Thomas Doyle is a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Colorado Boulder and the 2025 Peerbots Research Fellow. As an HRI researcher, Dylan's work focuses on values-based design for robots and the impacts of socio-technical contexts on the perception of robot identity.

## Research Focus

Dylan's fellowship research conducts a qualitative study examining the adoption of expressive faces for humanoid robots in industry and academia, with particular attention to systems like the Peerbots face. The study employs speculative design methods to understand the considerations and needs that decision-makers take into account when determining the facial expression capabilities of the robots they are designing.

## Background

Outside of research, Dylan serves as the Director of the AI for All Tomorrows media collective and podcast, bringing together perspectives on technology and its societal impacts.

Dylan received his PhD from the University of Colorado Boulder, Masters of Divinity from Columbia University, and BA from Sarah Lawrence College. This unique interdisciplinary background combines technical expertise with deep humanistic training. Prior to a career in technology research, Dylan served as a Unitarian Universalist minister and hospital chaplain, bringing a distinctive perspective on human values and care to robotics research.

## Peerbots Research Fellowship

As the 2025 Peerbots Research Fellow, Dylan is conducting research that aligns with Peerbots' mission to raise the floor of Human-Robot Interaction research and center people in how robots are researched, developed, and used. The fellowship supports completion of at least one study and submission of a publication to a leading academic venue.
