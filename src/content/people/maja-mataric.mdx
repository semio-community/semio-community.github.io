Maja Matarić is the Chan Soon-Shiong Distinguished Professor of Computer Science at the University of Southern California, where she leads pioneering research in socially assistive robotics, human-robot interaction, and multi-robot systems.

As the founding director of the USC Robotics and Autonomous Systems Center (RASC) and co-director of the USC Robotics Research Lab, she has made fundamental contributions to the field of socially assistive robotics, developing robot-assisted therapies for autism spectrum disorders, stroke rehabilitation, Alzheimer's disease, and healthy aging.

Her work bridges computer science, neuroscience, and rehabilitation, creating innovative robotic systems that provide personalized assistance and motivation to users through social interaction rather than physical contact. She is a Fellow of multiple prestigious organizations including the AAAS, IEEE, AAAI, and ACM.
