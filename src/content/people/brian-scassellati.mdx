Brian Scassellati is the A. Bartlett Giamatti Professor of Computer Science at Yale University and Director of the Yale Social Robotics Lab. A pioneer in social robotics, his research focuses on building embodied computational models of human social behavior, especially for assistive robotics applications in autism therapy, education, and rehabilitation.

With over two decades of experience in the field, Brian has made fundamental contributions to our understanding of how robots can perceive, understand, and respond to human social cues. His work on robots for autism therapy has been particularly influential, developing systems that can engage children with autism spectrum disorders in therapeutic interactions that improve social skills and communication.

As the director of the Yale Social Robotics Lab, he leads a multidisciplinary team exploring questions at the intersection of robotics, artificial intelligence, and human cognition. His research has resulted in numerous breakthroughs in areas such as joint attention, theory of mind for robots, and the development of socially assistive robots that can adapt to individual users' needs.

Brian is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) and has received numerous awards for his contributions to robotics and human-robot interaction. He is deeply committed to translating research into real-world applications that can improve quality of life for individuals with developmental and cognitive differences.
