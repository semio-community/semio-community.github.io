Ross Mead is the CEO and Founder of Semio AI, and a driving force behind the Semio Community initiative. With a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Southern California, he has dedicated his career to advancing human-robot interaction and making social robotics accessible to researchers, educators, and developers worldwide.

His research focuses on understanding and modeling the social dynamics of human-robot interaction, particularly in the areas of proxemics (spatial relationships) and multi-modal communication. Through Semio, he works to democratize access to social robotics technologies and foster reproducible, replicable research in the HRI community.

As a leader in the field, Ross is committed to building bridges between academia and industry, promoting open science practices, and creating sustainable infrastructure for the next generation of robotics researchers and practitioners. His vision for the Semio Community encompasses not just technology development, but the cultivation of an inclusive, collaborative ecosystem that advances the entire field of human-centered robotics.
