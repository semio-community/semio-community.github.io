honorific: Dr.
title: Human-Robot Interaction Researcher and Software Engineer
bio: "Chris Birmingham is a human-robot interaction researcher and software
  engineer at Semio AI. He earned a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the
  University of Southern California in March 2023 with a concentration in
  Socially Assistive Robotics. His dissertation, Multiparty Human-Robot
  Interaction: Methods For Facilitating Social Support, developed computational
  models of group dynamics (e.g., turn-taking and trust) and a facilitation
  framework grounded in empathy and disclosure. Chris builds open-source tools
  for reproducible HRI, including HCI-FACE (a web-based facial animation and
  conversation engine) and HARMONI (a ROS-based modular interaction framework).
  His work spans multimodal perception, time-series modeling for affect
  recognition, and end-to-end deployment across cloud and robot platforms."
