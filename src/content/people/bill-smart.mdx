Bill Smart is a Professor at Oregon State University, specializing in robotics, machine learning, and human-robot interaction. With decades of experience in the field, he has made significant contributions to mobile robotics, robot learning, and the development of practical robotic systems for real-world applications.

His research spans a wide range of topics including autonomous navigation, reinforcement learning for robotics, and the development of robust software architectures for complex robotic systems. Bill has been instrumental in advancing the state of mobile robotics and has worked extensively on making robots more capable of operating in unstructured, real-world environments.

As an educator and mentor, Bill is committed to training the next generation of roboticists and has supervised numerous graduate students who have gone on to make their own significant contributions to the field. His practical approach to robotics research emphasizes building systems that work reliably outside the laboratory, making robotics technology more accessible and useful for society.
