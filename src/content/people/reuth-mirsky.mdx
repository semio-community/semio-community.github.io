Reuth Mirsky is an Assistant Professor at Tufts University, specializing in artificial intelligence, multi-agent systems, and human-AI collaboration. Her research focuses on developing AI systems that can effectively understand, predict, and collaborate with humans in complex, dynamic environments.

Her work bridges the gap between theoretical AI and practical applications in human-robot interaction, with particular emphasis on plan recognition, theory of mind modeling, and creating AI agents that can adapt to and work alongside human partners. She is passionate about making AI systems more transparent, trustworthy, and effective in real-world collaborative scenarios.

Prior to joining Tufts, she completed her Ph.D. at Ben-Gurion University and held postdoctoral positions at UT Austin and Harvard University, building a strong interdisciplinary foundation that informs her approach to human-centered AI and robotics research.
