## Overview

Jibo emerged from MIT Media Lab's Personal Robots Group under the direction of Cynthia Breazeal, pioneering the concept of a social robot designed specifically for home environments. The robot's distinctive design features a stationary base with a three-axis motor system that enables fluid, lifelike movements including turns and expressive gestures. Its animated face displayed on an HD touchscreen creates engaging social interactions through dynamic expressions and eye contact tracking, while 360-degree sound localization allows natural voice interactions from anywhere in the room.

The platform has evolved into the Jibo Research Platform, providing researchers with a deployable infrastructure for social robotics experimentation and data collection. This research-oriented version extends the original hardware and software architecture with enhanced capabilities for academic study, including improved data security measures and developer tools. The system's Linux-based architecture and accompanying SDK enable researchers and developers to create custom applications and behaviors, facilitating diverse studies in human-robot interaction and social robotics applications.
