## Overview

Quori is an affordable, modular social robot platform developed through a National Science Foundation initiative to democratize human-robot interaction research. Created through extensive community consultation, the robot features a distinctive rear-projected animated face for flexible expression design, two articulated arms with shoulder-like movement, a bowing spine mechanism, and an omnidirectional mobile base capable of smooth navigation in both laboratory and real-world settings. The platform's modular architecture allows researchers to customize and extend capabilities while maintaining standardization across the ten units distributed to U.S. research institutions.

The robot bridges technical accessibility gaps by providing control interfaces at multiple levels - from low-level ROS commands for direct hardware control to browser-based tools for creating conversational content and animations without extensive programming expertise. This tiered approach, combined with open-source hardware documentation and swappable components, enables diverse research applications ranging from non-verbal communication studies to field deployments in public spaces, all while maintaining ADA compliance and quiet operation suitable for human interaction contexts.
