## Overview

Quori v2.0 represents a significant advancement in socially interactive robot platforms, building upon the successful foundation established by the National Science Foundation initiative. This enhanced version features a comprehensive sensor suite including an RGB+D camera, dual laser rangefinders, and four IMUs for superior environmental perception and stability. The robot's interaction capabilities have been dramatically expanded with a touchscreen display for direct user engagement, dual speakers for immersive audio experiences, and four programmable light arrays that enable rich visual communication patterns.

The mechanical design has evolved to offer 14 degrees of freedom, including sophisticated 4-DOF arms (8 DOF total) for complex gestural expression, a 2-DOF head with 1-DOF neck for nuanced non-verbal communication, and a 3-DOF holonomic base for smooth omnidirectional navigation. Additional features like the onboard storage bin enable practical applications in service scenarios, while the customizable badge system allows for personalization in multi-robot deployments. This modular architecture maintains backward compatibility while offering researchers unprecedented flexibility in customizing and extending the platform's capabilities for diverse human-robot interaction studies.
