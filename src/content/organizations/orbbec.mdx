  developed a comprehensive ROS-compatible open-source software module for the
  RGB+D camera to enable simultaneous use of the sensor's color, infrared,
  depth, point cloud, colorized body mask, skeleton-tracking, and hand-tracking
  streams; which has since become the official ROS package for the Orbbec Astra
