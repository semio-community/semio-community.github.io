## Overview

Semio partnered with Orbbec to create a ROS driver that exposes every Astra
sensor modality through a single, well-documented module. The package supports
out-of-the-box streaming of synchronized RGB, infrared, depth, point cloud, and
segmentation data, plus higher-level skeleton and hand tracking outputs that
enable expressive HRI use cases.

## Official Orbbec Support

Following deployments on Quori and other Semio-affiliated platforms, the module
was adopted as Orbbec's official ROS package for Astra-class devices. The repo
now anchors the shared maintenance pipeline, ensuring upstream SDK updates and
community pull requests quickly reach production robots.

## Integration Highlights

- Drop-in launch files for Semio's demonstrations, with parameter presets for
  labs and public showcases.
- Utilities that colorize depth frames, align masks with TF trees, and capture
  calibration snapshots for reproducible experiments.
- Extensive topic documentation so researchers can subscribe only to the streams
  they need while keeping the rest available for future behaviors.
