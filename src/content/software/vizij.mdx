## Overview

Vizij is an open-source ecosystem designed to address the fragmentation in robot face development by providing a unified platform for designing, animating, and deploying expressive rendered robot faces. Unlike existing solutions that require researchers to create custom, non-standard tools for each project, Vizij offers a comprehensive pipeline that enables code sharing, collaboration between diverse stakeholders, and the development of reusable components that can advance the entire field of human-robot interaction.

At its core, Vizij implements a data-flow architecture with multiple abstraction layers, allowing different roles—from 3D designers to HRI researchers—to contribute their expertise without needing to understand the entire system. The platform provides standardized interfaces for three critical aspects of robot facial expression: emotion mapping, viseme generation for speech synchronization, and gaze control for joint attention and turn-taking behaviors.

## Key Components

### Face Properties & Rendering
The base layer handles the rendering of primitive shapes and elements that compose the robot face, supporting both single and multi-screen configurations. Faces can be imported from standard 3D formats (GLTF/GLB) created in tools like Blender, or composed using Vizij's built-in component system.

### Rigging System
Vizij introduces a dual-layer rigging approach:
- **Face-Specific Rigs**: Map high-level properties to low-level rendering values for individual face designs
- **Abstract Rigs**: Provide face-agnostic control interfaces that work across different robot platforms

### Standard Control Interfaces
The platform defines community standards for:
- **Emotion Expression**: Supporting multiple emotion models including FACS, PAD, and layered approaches
- **Visemes**: Enabling lip synchronization for educational and communication applications
- **Gaze Systems**: Implementing joint attention, turn-taking, and intimacy regulation behaviors

## Supported Roles

Vizij is designed to accommodate various stakeholder roles in the robot face development pipeline:

- **Designers**: Create and modify face elements using existing 3D modeling tools
- **Face Riggers**: Connect rig systems to specific face elements
- **Abstraction Riggers**: Define face-agnostic control abstractions
- **Animators**: Create behaviors and animations for face elements
- **Interaction Designers**: Design the overall user experience and interaction flows
- **Developers**: Programmatically control faces through well-defined APIs

## Research Support

Developed with support from NSF grants (IIS-2235042/2235043), Vizij enables replicable scientific studies by allowing researchers to share face assets, rigs, and animations. The standardized interfaces mean that code developed for one robot face can be easily adapted to work with others, significantly improving research reproducibility and accelerating development cycles.
