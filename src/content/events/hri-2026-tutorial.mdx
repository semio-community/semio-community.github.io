# Vizij: A Tutorial on Designing, Animating, and Deploying Rendered Robot Faces

## What is Vizij?

[Vizij](http://github.com/vizij-ai) is an Open Source Ecosystem (OSE) for **designing, animating, and deploying rendered robot faces** developed to address the existing fragmentation in rendered robot face infrastructure.

An overview of the Vizij system is described in [this brief preprint](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/397497233_Vizij_Supporting_the_design_animation_and_deployment_of_rendered_robot_faces) from [UR-RAD 2025](https://ur-rad.github.io/).

Vizij includes a standardized yet modular rig and controller system designed for diverse face morphologies while remaining extensible for stylistic variation and application constraints. It provides semantic schemas for facial features, testable interfaces, and reference assets, supported by modern development practices. Compared with ad‑hoc or proprietary stacks, Vizij emphasizes interoperability, reproducibility, and extensibility. Vizij  provides libraries and reference assets for **_designing_** (face asset creation, modification, and rigging), **_animating_** (modifying face properties over time), and **_deploying_** (making expressive faces available on live robots) rendered robot faces, including standardized semantics and controllers for gaze, visemes, and emotional expression. 

Several robot platform partners are already using or have begun experimenting with using Vizij including [Quori](http://quori.org/), [Peerbots](https://www.peerbots.org/), and [Ommie](http://scazlab.yale.edu/ommie-robot).


## Who should attend?

We designed the tutorial for a broad audience from industry and academia and for both junior PhD students as well as advisors / Principal Investigators (PIs). The tutorial is for those who want their robot faces to “just work” as well as those who want to fully customize a robot face to run user studies evaluating those customizations.


## Scheduled Activities

This tutorial will be “hands-on” with participants getting to use the Vizij tools and software packages on their laptops. 

1. Getting started with Face Design & Control

   1. Hello Face: getting started importing, exporting, and controlling a robot face.

   2. Renderer Data Model: The Vizij renderer, underlying data, and how that data can be modified

   3. Rigging: Standard and custom control rigs in Vizij

2. Face Animation, Integration, and Deployment

   1. Now we are talking: integrating a robot face with a real time conversation engine.

   2. Animations: defining, saving, and loading animations.

   3. Deployment: Going from your computer to your robot.

We plan to tailor activities to attendees. Please fill out [this survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeSN691ChFbA6F5V42xyz66LuwGvKaM98rIPM5SGdI4VrDpdg/viewform?usp=publish-editor) to let us know about your interest in the tutorial and what robot(s) you work with. We may be able to provide you with a robot at the tutorial.


## Tutorial Preparation (optional)

This section is pending. We will provide tutorial resources ahead of the tutorial for those interested in getting started early. This will be optional and participants do not need to do any installation or preparation ahead of the tutorial to participate aside from bringing a laptop. 


## Participant Support

Thanks to the [Quori](http://quori.org/) project, participant travel support ($ amount TBD based on availability) is available for up to 20 participants who wish to attend _but do not have existing funding to cover tutorial attendance_. Please select the relevant choices in the [survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeSN691ChFbA6F5V42xyz66LuwGvKaM98rIPM5SGdI4VrDpdg/viewform?usp=publish-editor), and we will reach out with more information. Participant support is available on a first come first serve basis.
