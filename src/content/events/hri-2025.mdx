## About HRI 2025

The ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction is the premier venue for showcasing the very best interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary research in human-robot interaction. Researchers from diverse backgrounds including robotics, computer science, engineering, design, behavioral and social sciences come together to define and advance the state-of-the-art in HRI.

## Conference Theme: "Robots in the Wild"

HRI 2025's theme focuses on deploying robots in real-world, uncontrolled environments. As robots move from laboratories into homes, workplaces, and public spaces, understanding how they interact with diverse populations in complex, dynamic settings becomes crucial.
