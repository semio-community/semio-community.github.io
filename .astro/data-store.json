Its animated face displayed on an HD touchscreen creates engaging social interactions through dynamic expressions and eye contact tracking, while 360-degree sound localization allows natural voice interactions from anywhere in the room.\n\nThe platform has evolved into the Jibo Research Platform, providing researchers with a deployable infrastructure for social robotics experimentation and data collection. This research-oriented version extends the original hardware and software architecture with enhanced capabilities for academic study, including improved data security measures and developer tools. The system's Linux-based architecture and accompanying SDK enable researchers and developers to create custom applications and behaviors, facilitating diverse studies in human-robot interaction and social robotics applications.\n\n## Research Publications\n\n- (2024). **Jibo Community Social Robot Research Platform @Scale.** *HRI 2024 Workshop/Tutorial*, Boulder, Colorado.

The robot's core functionality centers on its unique haptic interaction design: it physically expands and contracts in a rhythmic breathing pattern while users place their hands on its soft, sweater-covered body. This mechanical breathing motion, combined with synchronized audio chimes and expressive eye animations, helps users naturally synchronize their own breathing to therapeutic deep breathing patterns that have been scientifically shown to calm the autonomic nervous system.\n\nInitial research with 43 participants at a university wellness center demonstrated Ommie's effectiveness, with users experiencing statistically significant reductions in anxiety state measures after interacting with the robot. Beyond the quantitative improvements, participants consistently rated the robot highly for its calming, approachable, and engaging qualities. Users particularly highlighted the focusing effect of the haptic interaction, reporting that the physical sensation helped them achieve a calmer state more quickly than traditional breathing exercises. Many participants also described experiencing a sense of companionship during the interaction, comparing it to the motivational benefits of group meditation. The robot has shown promise beyond adult anxiety management, with ongoing applications in pediatric healthcare settings where it has been successfully deployed to help children manage stress during oral allergy challenges. Recent work has also explored the application of machine learning algorithms to detect deep breathing phase for monitoring and adjusting deep breathing practices. Future work involves expanding use of the robot to new populations benefitting from deep breathing, as well as more longitudinal, in-the-wild experimentation.\n\n## Research Publications\n\n- Chun, A., Mamantov, E., Stahl, U., Scassellati, B., & Leeds, S.
