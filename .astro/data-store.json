Unlike existing solutions that require researchers to create custom, non-standard tools for each project, Vizij offers a comprehensive pipeline that enables code sharing, collaboration between diverse stakeholders, and the development of reusable components that can advance the entire field of human-robot interaction.\n\nAt its core, Vizij implements a data-flow architecture with multiple abstraction layers, allowing different roles—from 3D designers to HRI researchers—to contribute their expertise without needing to understand the entire system. The platform provides standardized interfaces for three critical aspects of robot facial expression: emotion mapping, viseme generation for speech synchronization, and gaze control for joint attention and turn-taking behaviors.\n\n## Key Components\n\n### Face Properties & Rendering\nThe base layer handles the rendering of primitive shapes and elements that compose the robot face, supporting both single and multi-screen configurations. Faces can be imported from standard 3D formats (GLTF/GLB) created in tools like Blender, or composed using Vizij's built-in component system.\n\n### Rigging System\nVizij introduces a dual-layer rigging approach:\n- **Face-Specific Rigs**: Map high-level properties to low-level rendering values for individual face designs\n- **Abstract Rigs**: Provide face-agnostic control interfaces that work across different robot platforms\n\n### Standard Control Interfaces\nThe platform defines community standards for:\n- **Emotion Expression**: Supporting multiple emotion models including FACS, PAD, and layered approaches\n- **Visemes**: Enabling lip synchronization for educational and communication applications\n- **Gaze Systems**: Implementing joint attention, turn-taking, and intimacy regulation behaviors\n\n## Supported Roles\n\nVizij is designed to accommodate various stakeholder roles in the robot face development pipeline:\n\n- **Designers**: Create and modify face elements using existing 3D modeling tools\n- **Face Riggers**: Connect rig systems to specific face elements\n- **Abstraction Riggers**: Define face-agnostic control abstractions\n- **Animators**: Create behaviors and animations for face elements\n- **Interaction Designers**: Design the overall user experience and interaction flows\n- **Developers**: Programmatically control faces through well-defined APIs\n\n## Research Support\n\nDeveloped with support from NSF grants (IIS-2235042/2235043), Vizij enables replicable scientific studies by allowing researchers to share face assets, rigs, and animations. The standardized interfaces mean that code developed for one robot face can be easily adapted to work with others, significantly improving research reproducibility and accelerating development cycles.","src/content/software/vizij.mdx",[346],"@/assets/images/software/vizij-icon.png","741cbfc2f8406934","hardware",["Map",350,351,394,395,464,465,514,515],"jibo",{"id":350,"data":352,"body":389,"filePath":390,"assetImports":391,"digest":393,"deferredRender":19},{"id":350,"name":353,"description":354,"shortDescription":355,"category":356,"status":229,"specifications":357,"features":368,"topics":378,"links":383,"images":386,"contributors":388,"featured":26,"draft":19},"Jibo","A social robot platform originally developed as the world's first commercial social robot for the home.

Its animated face displayed on an HD touchscreen creates engaging social interactions through dynamic expressions and eye contact tracking, while 360-degree sound localization allows natural voice interactions from anywhere in the room.\n\nThe platform has evolved into the Jibo Research Platform, providing researchers with a deployable infrastructure for social robotics experimentation and data collection. This research-oriented version extends the original hardware and software architecture with enhanced capabilities for academic study, including improved data security measures and developer tools. The system's Linux-based architecture and accompanying SDK enable researchers and developers to create custom applications and behaviors, facilitating diverse studies in human-robot interaction and social robotics applications.\n\n## Research Publications\n\n- (2024). **Jibo Community Social Robot Research Platform @Scale.** *HRI 2024 Workshop/Tutorial*, Boulder, Colorado.

The robot's core functionality centers on its unique haptic interaction design: it physically expands and contracts in a rhythmic breathing pattern while users place their hands on its soft, sweater-covered body. This mechanical breathing motion, combined with synchronized audio chimes and expressive eye animations, helps users naturally synchronize their own breathing to therapeutic deep breathing patterns that have been scientifically shown to calm the autonomic nervous system.\n\nInitial research with 43 participants at a university wellness center demonstrated Ommie's effectiveness, with users experiencing statistically significant reductions in anxiety state measures after interacting with the robot. Beyond the quantitative improvements, participants consistently rated the robot highly for its calming, approachable, and engaging qualities. Users particularly highlighted the focusing effect of the haptic interaction, reporting that the physical sensation helped them achieve a calmer state more quickly than traditional breathing exercises. Many participants also described experiencing a sense of companionship during the interaction, comparing it to the motivational benefits of group meditation. The robot has shown promise beyond adult anxiety management, with ongoing applications in pediatric healthcare settings where it has been successfully deployed to help children manage stress during oral allergy challenges. Recent work has also explored the application of machine learning algorithms to detect deep breathing phase for monitoring and adjusting deep breathing practices. Future work involves expanding use of the robot to new populations benefitting from deep breathing, as well as more longitudinal, in-the-wild experimentation.\n\n## Research Publications\n\n- **Beilenson, J., Sahin, R., Zhong, Y., Brewer, R., Tang, F., Nguyen, L., Juca, M., Kofinas, D., Nelson, J., Scassellati, B.** (2024).
