The robot's core functionality centers on its unique haptic interaction design: it physically expands and contracts in a rhythmic breathing pattern while users place their hands on its soft, sweater-covered body. This mechanical breathing motion, combined with synchronized audio chimes and expressive eye animations, helps users naturally synchronize their own breathing to therapeutic deep breathing patterns that have been scientifically shown to calm the autonomic nervous system.\n\nInitial research with 43 participants at a university wellness center demonstrated Ommie's effectiveness, with users experiencing statistically significant reductions in anxiety state measures after interacting with the robot. Beyond the quantitative improvements, participants consistently rated the robot highly for its calming, approachable, and engaging qualities. Users particularly highlighted the focusing effect of the haptic interaction, reporting that the physical sensation helped them achieve a calmer state more quickly than traditional breathing exercises. Many participants also described experiencing a sense of companionship during the interaction, comparing it to the motivational benefits of group meditation. The robot has shown promise beyond adult anxiety management, with ongoing applications in pediatric healthcare settings where it has been successfully deployed to help children manage stress during oral allergy challenges. Recent work has also explored the application of machine learning algorithms to detect deep breathing phase for monitoring and adjusting deep breathing practices. Future work involves expanding use of the robot to new populations benefitting from deep breathing, as well as more longitudinal, in-the-wild experimentation.\n\n## Research Publications\n\n- Chun, A., Mamantov, E., Stahl, U., Scassellati, B., & Leeds, S.

Created through extensive community consultation, the robot features a distinctive rear-projected animated face for flexible expression design, two articulated arms with shoulder-like movement, a bowing spine mechanism, and an omnidirectional mobile base capable of smooth navigation in both laboratory and real-world settings. The platform's modular architecture allows researchers to customize and extend capabilities while maintaining standardization across the ten units distributed to U.S. research institutions.\n\nThe robot bridges technical accessibility gaps by providing control interfaces at multiple levels - from low-level ROS commands for direct hardware control to browser-based tools for creating conversational content and animations without extensive programming expertise. This tiered approach, combined with open-source hardware documentation and swappable components, enables diverse research applications ranging from non-verbal communication studies to field deployments in public spaces, all while maintaining ADA compliance and quiet operation suitable for human interaction contexts.\n\n## Research Publications\n\n- Specian, A., Eckenstein, N., Mead, R., McDorman, B., Kim, S., Mataric, M., & Yim, M.
