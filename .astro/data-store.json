The robot's core functionality centers on its unique haptic interaction design: it physically expands and contracts in a rhythmic breathing pattern while users place their hands on its soft, sweater-covered body. This mechanical breathing motion, combined with synchronized audio chimes and expressive eye animations, helps users naturally synchronize their own breathing to therapeutic deep breathing patterns that have been scientifically shown to calm the autonomic nervous system.\n\nInitial research with 43 participants at a university wellness center demonstrated Ommie's effectiveness, with users experiencing statistically significant reductions in anxiety state measures after interacting with the robot. Beyond the quantitative improvements, participants consistently rated the robot highly for its calming, approachable, and engaging qualities. Users particularly highlighted the focusing effect of the haptic interaction, reporting that the physical sensation helped them achieve a calmer state more quickly than traditional breathing exercises. Many participants also described experiencing a sense of companionship during the interaction, comparing it to the motivational benefits of group meditation. The robot has shown promise beyond adult anxiety management, with ongoing applications in pediatric healthcare settings where it has been successfully deployed to help children manage stress during oral allergy challenges. Recent work has also explored the application of machine learning algorithms to detect deep breathing phase for monitoring and adjusting deep breathing practices. Future work involves expanding use of the robot to new populations benefitting from deep breathing, as well as more longitudinal, in-the-wild experimentation.\n\n## Research Publications\n\n- **Beilenson, J., Sahin, R., Zhong, Y., Brewer, R., Tang, F., Nguyen, L., Juca, M., Kofinas, D., Nelson, J., Scassellati, B.** (2024).

Built on the principle that natural language should be the primary interface for human-robot interaction, Arora provides an integrated suite of tools that significantly reduces development time - aiming to cut content creation time by 60%, software integration by 75%, and product launch timelines by 90%.\n\nThe platform enables developers and researchers to rapidly prototype and deploy sophisticated robot behaviors through its three core modules: voice scripting for conversational interactions, animation tools for expressive movements, and a JavaScript SDK for custom functionality. This unified approach allows teams to create, test in simulation, deploy to hardware, and analyze usage data all within a single ecosystem, making it ideal for both research institutions conducting HRI studies and companies developing commercial robot applications.","src/content/software/arora.mdx",[794],"@/assets/images/software/arora-hero.png","43842dfaca0cc140","events",["Map",798,799],"hri-2025",{"id":798,"data":800,"body":843,"filePath":844,"digest":845,"deferredRender":19},{"name":801,"displayName":802,"description":803,"type":804,"format":805,"startDate":806,"endDate":807,"registrationDeadline":808,"location":809,"organizers":816,"speakers":817,"sponsors":818,"tracks":821,"topics":828,"links":836,"featured":19,"tags":840},"HRI 2025: ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction","HRI 2025","The 20th Annual ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction is the premier venue for presenting and discussing cutting-edge research in human-robot interaction.
